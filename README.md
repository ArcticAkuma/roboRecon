### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a minor-level university project focused on developing a self-driving car prototype.
Currently, there is only the code adjustments to the [Donkeycar](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar) software published.

### Donkeycar Patches
Patches regarding Donkeycar are simply made to enable easy implementation of ROS 1. 
They are applied through a simple script overriding changed classes directly in the python environment.
This is a very basic solution.
